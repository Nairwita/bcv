function [locations, responses] = wdetectors(detectors)
% WDETECTORS Location and orientation data for gravitational wave detectors
%
% WDETECTORS returns the location and response matrix for the specified
% gravitational wave detectors.
%
%  usage:
%
%    [locations, responses] = wdetectors(detectors);
%
%    detectors      cell array of site, detector, or channel names
%
%    locations      cell array of detector locations [s]
%    responses      cell array of detector response matrices []
%
% The list of detectors should be specified as a cell array of site identifiers
% or channel names.  Site identifiers are determined by taking the first
% character of each channel name.  The following sites are recognized.
%
%   G  GEO
%   H  LIGO Hanford
%   L  LIGO Livingston
%   V  Virgo
%   0  Fiducial reference detecor
%
% The returned detector location and response data are cell arrays, with one
% cell per detector.
%
% The returned detector location data correspond to the speed of light travel
% time from the center of the Earth, as used by the WRESPONSE and WBASELINE
% functions.
%
% The returned detector response data are dimensionless response matrices as
% used by the WRESPONSE function.
%
% The fiducial reference detector is provided for validation purposes.  It is
% positioned in the direction of the North pole, at a distance equal to one
% speed of light travel time from the Earth center, and has arms along the
% positive X and Y axis in the Earth fixed geocentric coordinate system.
