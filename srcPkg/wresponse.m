function [fplus, fcross, deltat] = wresponse(coordinates, detectors)
% WRESPONSE Antenna response for a given detector and source coordinates
%
% WRESPONSE computes the response of the specified gravitational wave detector
% to both polarizations of gravitational wave signal coming from the specified
% directions on the sky with
%
%  usage:
%
%    [fplus, fcross, deltat] = wresponse(coordinates, detectors);
%
%    coordinates    matrix of sky positions and polarization angles [radians]
%    detectors      cell array of site, detector, or channel names
%
%    fplus          matrix of plus polarization antenna response factors
%    fcross         matrix of cross polarization antenna response factors
%    deltat         matrix of time delays relative to earth center
%
% The sky positions and polarizations should be provided as a three column
% matrix of spherical coordinates in the form [theta phi psi].  The coordinate
% theta is a geocentric colatitude running from 0 at the North pole to pi at the
% South pole, and the coordinate phi is the geocentric longitude in Earth fixed
% coordinates with 0 on the prime meridian.  The polarization psi is defined as
% the right handed angle about the direction of propagation from the negative
% phi direction to the plus polarization direction of the source.  The range of
% theta is [0, pi] and the range of phi is [0, 2 pi).  The range of psi is [0,
% pi).  If the coordinate matrix has only two columns, they are assumed to be
% theta and phi values and psi is assumed to be zero.  If the coordinate matrix
% has more than three columns, the additional columns are simply ignored.
%
% The list of detectors should be specified as a cell array of site identifiers
% or channel names, which are passed to the WDETECTORS function to retrieve the
% corresponding detector location and response data.  Site identifiers are
% determined by taking the first character of each channel name.  The following
% sites are recognized by the WDETECTORS function.
%
%   G  GEO
%   H  LIGO Hanford
%   L  LIGO Livingston
%   V  Virgo
%   0  Fiducial reference detecor
%
% The resulting fplus, fcross, deltat matrices contain a column for each detector
% and a row for each coordinate.
%
% The fiducial reference detector is provided for validation purposes.  It is
% positioned in the direction of the North pole, at a distance equal to one
% speed of light travel time from the Earth center, and has arms along the
% positive X and Y axis in the Earth fixed geocentric coordinate system.
