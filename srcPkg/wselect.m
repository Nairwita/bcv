% WSELECT Identify statistically significant events in Discrete Q transforms
%
% WSELECT selects statistically significant events from the set of statitically
% significant Q transform tiles.  Events are defined by the properties of their
% most significant tile and are identified by exluding the less significant of
% any overlapping tiles.  The input significant tiles are first sorted by
% decreasing normalized energy.  Starting with the most significant tile, tiles
% are discarded if they overlap with a more significant tile.  The remaining set
% of tiles comprises a minimal set of tiles that describes an event.
%
% WSELECT returns a cell array of significant event properties
%
% usage: events = wselect(significants, durationInflation, ...
%                         bandwidthInflation, maximumEvents, ...
%                         debugLevel);
%
%   significants         cell array of significant tiles properties
%   durationInflation    multiplicative scale factor for duration
%   bandwidthInflation   multiplicative scale factor for bandwidth
%   maximumEvents        maximum allowable number of events
%   debugLevel           verboseness of debug output
%
%   events               cell array of significant event properties
%
% The optional durationInflation and bandwidthInflation arguments are
% multiplicative scale factors that are applied to the duration and bandwidth of
% significant tiles prior to testing for overlap.  If not specified, these
% parameters both default to unity such that the resulting tiles have unity
% time-frequency area.  The normalized energy of the resulting tiles are scaled
% by the product of the duration and bandwidth inflation factors to avoid over
% counting the total energy of clusters of tiles.  Likewise, the amplitude of
% the resulting tiles is scaled by the square root of the product of the
% duration and bandwidth inflation factors.
%
% The optional maximumEvents argument provides a safety mechanism to limit the
% total number of events returned by WSELECT.  If this maximum number of events
% is exceeded, an overflow flag is set, only the maximumEvents most significant
% events are returned, and a warning is issued if debugLevel is set to unity or
% higher.  By default, maximumEvents is set to infinity and debugLevel is set to
% unity.
%
% WSELECT both expects and returns a cell array of Q transform event structures
% with one cell per channel.  The event structures contain the following
% required fields, which describe the properties of statistically significant
% tiles.  Additional fields such as amplitude, phase, or coherent transform
% properties are optional and are retained along with the required fields.
%
%   time                 center time of tile [gps seconds]
%   frequency            center frequency of tile [Hz]
%   duration             duration of tile [seconds]
%   bandwidth            bandwidth of tile [Hz]
%   normalizedEnergy     normalized energy of tile []
%
% The event structures also contain the following flag, which indicates if the
% maximum number of significant tiles or significant events was exceeded.
%
%   overflowFlag         boolean overflow flag
